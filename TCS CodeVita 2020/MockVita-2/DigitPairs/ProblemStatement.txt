Digit Pairs

Problem Description


Given N three-digit numbers, your task is to find bit score of all N numbers and then print the number of pairs possible based on these calculated bit score
.

1. Rule for calculating bit score from three digit number:


From the 3-digit number,


 extract largest digit and multiply by 11 then


 extract smallest digit multiply by 7 then

 add both the result for getting bit pairs.


Note: - Bit score should be of 2-digits, if above results in a 3-digit bit score, simply ignore most significant digit.


Consider following examples:


Say, number is 286

Largest digit is 8 and smallest digit is 2

So, 8*11+2*7 =102 so ignore most significant bit , So bit score = 02.


Say, Number is 123

Largest digit is 3 and smallest digit is 1

So, 3*11+7*1=40, so bit score is 40.

2.
 Rules for making pairs from above calculated bit scores

Condition for making pairs are


 Both bit scores should be in either odd position or even position to be eligible to form a pair.


 Pairs can be only made if most significant digit are same and at most two pair can be made for a given significant digit.


Constraints

N<=500

Input Format

First line contains an integer N, denoting the count of numbers.

Second line contains N 3-digit integers delimited by space

Output

One integer value denoting the number of bit pairs.
