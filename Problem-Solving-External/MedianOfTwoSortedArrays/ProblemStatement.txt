Given two sorted arrays of different sizes, m and n. Return the median of these two arrays.

Input

3
1 2 3
3
4 5 6

Output:

3.5

Explanation:

The merge point of two sorted arrays is same as median of two sorted arrays.
After the array has been merged. The following is the resultant array.
1 2 3 4 5 6
Since the average of even elements is ( nums(n/2) + nums(n/2)+1 ) / 2. i.e (3+4)/2 = 3.5
