Write a function that returns a character mapping from a word.


Examples


character_mapping("abcd") ? [0, 1, 2, 3]


character_mapping("abb") ? [0, 1, 1]


character_mapping("babbcb") ? [0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0]


character_mapping("hmmmmm") ? [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]


Notes

Start your counter at 0, and increment by 1 each time you encounter a new character.


Identical characters should share the same number.
