Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8

//If sorting is allowed use Binary Search method based on in-consistency and consistency approach.
//Bit Manipulation if sorting not allowed.
//HashSet can also be used by comparing every set elements with 1-N elements from for loop.
//n(n+1)/2 can also be used to find the missing number in range 1 to n. sum - n(n+1)/2 gives the missing number.
