1.Flip Bit method if the array is not read only.
2.Sort and linear search if array is not read only.
3.Sort and Binary Search.
4.Binary Search without sort.
5.Array to keep count of all elements, if count >=2 return ele
6.Set instead of array.

All these solutions [except binary search without sorting] are useful when array is not read only.
7. But when the array is not read only then cycle detection algorithm by Floyd is the one to choose for.
