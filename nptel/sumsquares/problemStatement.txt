Write a Python function sumsquare(l) that takes a nonempty list of integers and returns a list [odd,even], where odd is the sum of squares all the odd numbers in l and even is the sum of squares of all the even numbers in l.

Here are some examples to show how your function should work.

>>> sumsquare([1,3,5])
[35, 0]

>>> sumsquare([2,4,6])
[0, 56]

>>> sumsquare([-1,-2,3,7])
[59, 4]
