Approach #3 Bit Manipulation [Accepted]

Intuition

We can harness the fact that XOR is its own inverse to find the missing element in linear time.

Algorithm

Because we know that nums contains nnn numbers and that it is missing exactly one number on the range [0..n-1][0..n-1][0..n-1], we know that nnn definitely replaces the missing number in nums. Therefore, if we initialize an integer to nnn and XOR it with every index and value, we will be left with the missing number. Consider the following example (the values have been sorted for intuitive convenience, but need not be):
Index 	0 	1 	2 	3
Value 	0 	1 	3 	4

missing=4?(0?0)?(1?1)?(2?3)?(3?4)=(4?4)?(0?0)?(1?1)?(3?3)?2=0?0?0?0?2=2 \begin{aligned} missing &= 4 \wedge (0 \wedge 0) \wedge (1 \wedge 1) \wedge (2 \wedge 3) \wedge (3 \wedge 4) \\ &= (4 \wedge 4) \wedge (0 \wedge 0) \wedge (1 \wedge 1) \wedge (3 \wedge 3) \wedge 2 \\ &= 0 \wedge 0 \wedge 0 \wedge 0 \wedge 2 \\ &= 2 \end{aligned} missing?=4?(0?0)?(1?1)?(2?3)?(3?4)=(4?4)?(0?0)?(1?1)?(3?3)?2=0?0?0?0?2=2?

Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity : O(n)\mathcal{O}(n)O(n)

    Assuming that XOR is a constant-time operation, this algorithm does constant work on nnn iterations, so the runtime is overall linear.

    Space complexity : O(1)\mathcal{O}(1)O(1)

    This algorithm allocates only constant additional space.

Approach #4 Gauss' Formula [Accepted]

Intuition

One of the most well-known stories in mathematics is of a young Gauss, forced to find the sum of the first 100 natural numbers by a lazy teacher. Rather than add the numbers by hand, he deduced a closed-form expression for the sum, or so the story goes. You can see the formula below:

?i=0ni=n(n+1)2 \sum_{i=0}^{n}i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} ?i=0n?i=2n(n+1)?

Algorithm

We can compute the sum of nums in linear time, and by Gauss' formula, we can compute the sum of the first nnn natural numbers in constant time. Therefore, the number that is missing is simply the result of Gauss' formula minus the sum of nums, as nums consists of the first nnn natural numbers minus some number.
