Given a string and number of testcases, the string is super ASCII iff the frequency
of all the characters is equal to the ASCII value of the character.
If the string is super ascii print "Yes" else print "No"
The ASCII value starts from a=1, b=2...z=6 here.

Input
2
abb scca

Output 
Yes
No

Explanation
1) Since count of a = 1 and b = 2 in the string "abb" , It is equal to super ascii value of a=1, b=2.
2) Since count of s = 1 , c = 2 and a = 1, It is not equal to respective super ascii values.
