BREADTH FIRST SEARCH

As the name goes the BFS algorithm completes its searching pattern until it reaches a node 
which does not further have any neighbouring nodes or until it reaches dead-nodes. 
		
/* n = 4
* 
* 0 1 1 0
* 0 0 1 0
* 1 0 0 1
* 0 0 0 1
* 
* Output = 0 2 3 1

So in the above adjaceny matrix if 0 is the source node, then we can assume that ,

  0 1 2 3 
0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0
2 1 0 0 1
3 0 0 0 1
 
the node 0 is a connected to 1 and 2 which happens to be its children in tree-terminology.
Out of 1 and 2 bfs algorithm chooses any one and traverse through all of their children. 
But according to structured implementation it will choose the last found children in this case 2.
So order till now is 0 2.
2 is connected to 0 and 3, since 0 is already visited we do not take into consideration.
add 3 to our list , it is 1 3 since 0 and 2 are already printed.
We look for children of 3 since its connected with itself, we skip it. We have reached to dead node.
So the order will be 0 2 3 1. 
Basically what BFS does is looks for children of a node, if it has then chooses any one and keeps going until it reaches the leaf node.
and then comes back to the other children and does the same.
Since we remove the last found element we make use of Stack data structure here.

Simulation of above graph:

n = no of nodes.
adjmatrix[][] = given graph in matrix form.
visited[n] = Individual flag for each node to check if it has been visited or not.
node = last popped node.

Intialization part before iterating,
First visit the source node which is 0. (can be anything) and update visited[0] = 1, pop the source node and assign its value to node, so node = 0.

Iterate,
check for neighbouring nodes for "node" and should not be visited before, i.e check if adjmatrix[node][0/1/2/3] = 1 and visited[0/1/2/3]!=1. If yes add to the stack.
check if the stack is empty after every addition is completed. Since its not, pop the last node and assign its value to "node" variable and repeat this process.
